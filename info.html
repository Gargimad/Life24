            <p>We are proud to say that we have 3,500 seats in total around our arena. It is split into 4 groups, with ten rows for groups A and C, and with 7 rows for groups B and D</p>
            <p>The format for stating your specific seat is explained at every booking form but here it is again:</p>
            <p>
                To choose your seat, first pick the side of the gymnasium you want to sit in: A, B, C, or D. Then, you need to pick the row that you'll sit in. 
                The row count starts from the top to the bottom. Separate these characters with a dot. Finally, pick the specific seat in the row based on the direction indicated.
                For instance, if the direction is to the right, the side is A, and you want to sit in the last row on the last seat, your desired seat will look like this: A.1.36
            </p>
            <p> Our booking forms contain he seats that are available at the current moment of time, ensuring that your information is accurate.</p>

                perfect for large events like trade shows to reduce a feeling of crowdness. Along with that, there are 3,500 seats outside the arena, which 
                is enough for a large audience to indulge in performances with perfect amount of space.
            </p>

                When needed, the disco ball can come down with a click of a button. We provide free wi-fi access, comfortable seating, and clean bathrooms:
                The seats contain arm rests and foam padding for comfort, and the bathrooms are cleaned every 3 hours by our team of helpful janitors working around the clock.
            </p>
