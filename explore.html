                <td><h2 id= "concerts">Live Concerts</h2>
                <p>We offer many live concerts year round. Beautiful orchestras, upbeat bands, and singers with beautiful 
                performances reserve our space every year. The 3,500 people that come to watch the concerts engage and learn
                the power of music. This February and March for example, Lithuaniaâ€™s Orchestra is coming to town and performing
                in our arena! Be sure to check them out by going to the tickets page and booking your ticket there. If you want
                to have a live concert to display your wonderful musical skills, we encourage you to get exposed to a diverse
                range of people who can listen and help you in your career. Concession stands provide drinks and food you can buy
                before entering the gymnasium for the event. </p></td>

                <td><h2 id= "sports">Sporting Events</h2>
                <p>Sporting events year round include games from seasonal indoor games, mainly volleyball and basketball, along with 
                indoor soccer games. These games contain tough competition between both teams and are very exciting to not only
                take part in but also to watch and cheer for these talented athletes. Our 3,500 seats provide sufficient audience to 
                cheer up athletes. Our gymnasium is also big enough for setting up martial arts events like taekwondo and karate tournaments.
                Our gymnasium is not only limited to these sports as members can host more indoor sports in our spaces. Concession
                stands are outside the gymnasium for members who want to watch the sports game while eating snacks or drinking a fresh drink.</p></td>

                <td><h2 id= "shows">Trade Shows</h2>
                <p>Trade shows can easily be hosted in our large gynasium. Booths can be set up with little effort and conferences can be 
                easily coordinated in an organized space. These shows contain a lot of opportunities for visitors to grow as a person along
                with their skills in the topics that the show offers. Additionally, these events are great for networking. Individuals can meet
                new people in these events and gain new friends. Again, concession stands outside the gymnasium enhance the experience.
